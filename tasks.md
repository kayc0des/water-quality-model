## Tasks:

### Data Loading: LINK TO DATASETLinks to an external site.

- Use the Pandas library to load the water quality dataset.
- Ensure that the dataset contains both features (X) and labels (Y).

### Data Preprocessing:

- Split the dataset into feature matrix (X) and target vector (Y).
- Verify that the features are appropriately formatted and scaled if necessary.

### Data Splitting:

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Use a suitable ratio (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).


### Model Architecture:

- Construct a neural network model using the Sequential API of Keras.
- Choose appropriate activation functions and layer sizes.
- Add Dense layers to the model.


### Regularization:

- Implement L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Tune the regularization hyperparameters if needed.


### Early Stopping:

- Apply early stopping to monitor the model's performance during training.
- Set up appropriate stopping criteria (e.g., monitoring validation loss).


### Model Training:

- Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
- Train the model using the training data.
- Monitor training progress and evaluate performance on the validation set.


### Model Evaluation:

-Evaluate the trained model on the testing set

### Submission Guidelines:
- Submit the Python code.
- Include the report documenting the entire process and results.
- Implement other regularization techniques such as dropout.
